                        Customization is the process of editing something to a point that the final change is satisfying. 
                        When we want to customize information systems, we need to consider modifying software-based applications, 
                        databases, user-interface, and integration. Some measures are needed to make sure that the process of the 
                        customization runs smoothly and prevents multiple potential errors from occurring, including testing, 
                        and training. These key aspects are used to ensure that a business meets all the requirements from end-users, 
                        stake-holders and decision-makers needed to meet its goals and objectives.

                        can be modified by the user to be on track with the business process, by creating custom modules to endure 
                        the way these applications function. Another method of alternating software applications that already exist, 
                        is to join third-party solutions to enhance them.

                        When databases are to be customized, it is important to consider the accuracy of the information 
                        presented in the database systems. Databases are modified, by creating custom queries and reports to 
                        meet the specific needs of the report design. This is a big benefit in database customization as the 
                        custom design is mainly focused on addressing the needs and objectives of the organization.

                        User Interface involves the interaction of the user and the computer system. 
                        Interface is customizable because business will eventually reach a point where the user 
                        must enlarge their experience in using a system for business purposes. When people in the 
                        business want to modify user interface, they need to think about the accessibility and usability 
                        when making UI changes. They should make sure individuals that are working in the business have enough 
                        access to all the resources that are required for their usage; if existing user interfaces do not meet 
                        these requirements, then customisation is necessary. Customizing UI can be done by modifying dashboards 
                        to ensure the display as much visual data types as possible for the user to make an analysis.

                        After coming up with the final customization of a computer system, it is important to make 
                        sure that all the changes made to a system such as the systems discussed earlier, are processing properly.
                        Any errors that are detected in customized components while testing are to be notified. 
                        The following type of testing methods that can be applied are:

                    <p>
                        <mark>Integration testing:</mark> Method that joins customized components as a single unit and runs the 
                        process to see how efficient the whole integrated unit processes.

                        <mark>User acceptance testing:</mark> This the final stage of any customization to ensure the software works as 
                        to how it was planned to work.

                        their missions. As discussed about visual discovery before, 
                        trends are discovered in a datasheet. In addition, every day 
                        data elaborates on the details of a new trend or maybe even new 
                        pattern that is found in the representation of processed ideas replacing existing trends.

                        It is also essential that all the users that are assigned a specific task are properly trained and develop 
                        the required skills needed to perform their task. If a user does not possess sufficient training for their 
                        given task, then this will make it more difficult for the whole information system to function properly as it 
                        requires all customized components within to process well.

                        Integration involves the process of combining different systems and applications with the use of software tools. 
                        When customized components of an information system are joined together as whole, it is important to make sure the 
                        data flows efficiently; this can be done by refreshing the whole software countless times. 
                        When modified components of information systems integrate, application programming interfaces 
                        can be used as well as web services.

                        Software applications, databases and user interface need to make use of security to identify and prevent 
                        potential disadvantages encountered in an information system. The most efficient security measure used to 
                        protect customised information systems is to commonly update and attach software parts to issue vulnerabilities 
                        found in the whole information system.

                        As discussed before in the beginning of this topic regarding the customization of Information System, 
                        the requirement of the whole system is monitored by scalability. To elaborate on this statement, IS requirements 
                        are prioritized in the weight of the impact they have on the whole system after customizing the components within 
                        the system and using them. At some point in life, information systems are going to want to update businesses with 
                        a few modifications and the requirements for the customized information system must be aligned with the growth of 
                        the business. To communicate about changes in the system, a well-organised schedule is made available for 
                        maintaining these changes so that no one in the organisation falls behind.

                        Once the whole customization is complete for all the components in the information system is complete, 
                        it is essential for the customised system to process prior to the standards and rules of the industry of the 
                        business as it will enable business that they can manage risks and still qualify for a specific industry.

                        assisting the whole joined system to process more efficiently in a business, thus making the output of information 
                        systems more accurate to the objectives of the business.
