                        AI's role in information systems in short is to enhance the capabilities of human decision makers, 
                        automate repetitive and complex tasks, and provide insights and predictions from large and diverse data sources.

                        <mark>Enhancing capabilities of human decision-making:</mark> AI helps decision makers make better decisions faster
                        by providing relevant and reliable information as well as suggestions and possible explanations. 
                        For example, A doctor may enter in a patient's symptoms the AI will then take this data along with other data 
                        (such as the patient's medical history) it will then suggest possible causes and treatments which could help 
                        the doctor come to a diagnosis faster.

                        <mark>Automate repetitive and complex tasks:</mark> AI automates tasks which are tedious, time-consuming, 
                        or error-prone, by performing them more efficiently and accurately. A good example of such would be in an 
                        accounting firm the AI system can scan invoices, receipts, and bank statements it will then extract the relevant
                        information such as amounts, dates, and categories. The AI then automatically update the accounting records and 
                        generate reports and insights. This saves tremendous time, reduces errors, and improves accuracy.

                        <mark>Provide insights and predictions:</mark> AI provides insights and predictions from data sets which are too 
                        large or complex for human analysis, by applying advanced techniques such as machine learning, data mining, and 
                        statistical modelling. For example, the AI can determine when the best time to sell strawberry flavoured ice-cream 
                        is based off data from customers spending habits on other products.

                        <mark>Natural language processing (NLP):</mark> This is the branch of AI that deals with the analysis and 
                        generation of natural language, such as text and speech. NLP can be used to create chatbots, voice assistants, 
                        sentiment analysis, text summarization, machine translation, and more. NLP with information systems allows users 
                        to interact with the data in a more intuitive way as they could ask for the data to be compared to other sources 
                        and would not have to think of the language barrier.

                        <mark>Computer vision:</mark> This is the branch of AI that deals with the processing and understanding of visual 
                        information, such as images and videos. Computer vision can be used to create facial recognition, 
                        object detection, scene understanding, image editing, etc. This makes it much easier to input various types of 
                        data from invoices to counting stock on hand. It also makes displaying the data in various graph much easier and
                        faster.

                        <mark>Machine learning:</mark> This is the branch of AI that deals with the creation and application of algorithms 
                        which learn from data and improve their performance over time. Machine learning can be used to create 
                        recommendation systems, anomaly detection, fraud detection, spam filtering, and many more. 
                        This technology enables companies to optimise their strategies and maximise sales by finding various patterns 
                        and trends from their recorded data.
