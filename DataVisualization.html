                        Data Visualization is the process of representing information via the use of graphic methods,
                        for example, showing processes information in a pie chart, histogram, and a pie chart.
                        Majority of users can understand information much better by witnessing a representation 
                        of data through the form of a graphic, or an image. Managers in the organization not only 
                        use data visualization for data purposes, but also use it to discover how the flow of the patterns 
                        work and the variation of trends occurring.

                        The overall purpose of data visualization is to provide efficient ideas for a business to achieve
                        the objectives of the business, additionally, it's essential for individuals in the organization 
                        to fully understand those ideas generated. The purpose is categorised into four groups, 
                        which are discussed as follows: (Machines, n.d.)
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Idea Generation:</mark> This is the first step of which, 
                        people think of raw ideas that are not proven properly to execute in the business. 
                        Managers gather the potential benefits that these unprocessed suggestions have as well 
                        as the potential concerns that they can lead to so that there's awareness of what could possibly 
                        go wrong and what can be done to come up with a solution.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Idea illustration:</mark> This is the step in which the process or status of the idea is monitored 
                        by the project manager. This is where training is done to ensure each employee assigned with 
                        a specific sub-task for the project develops all the necessary skills to accomplish their 
                        individual task. Communication between the manager and an employee working on a sub-task is 
                        enabled so that the manager has assurances that the employee is doing fine or that they may need 
                        their guidance or assistance when they are faced with a problem.

                        <mark>Visual Discovery:</mark> As discussed in the beginning of this discussion, 
                        data visualization is also used to discover the pattern flow of generated 
                        ideas and trends within the datasheet; this is the role of visual discovery.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Every day data viz:</mark> This purpose is linked to visual discovery in terms of 
                        their missions. As discussed about visual discovery before, 
                        trends are discovered in a datasheet. In addition, every day 
                        data elaborates on the details of a new trend or maybe even new 
                        pattern that is found in the representation of processed ideas replacing existing trends.

                        Data Visualization is an important process for people working in the business 
                        as it will help them to understand information better. If information is 
                        not understood by an individual then there is no point in putting that information 
                        for use as they would not even know where to start, when people don't know where to start they will 
                        not be able to carry on from where they started and this will be major disadvantage of achieving a 
                        certain goal at the end of the whole process.

                        Data visualization has multiple advantages that can benefit companies, such as:
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Better understanding:</mark> Humans can process and understand information 
                        of a concept better in graphical form, for example a picture.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Information is shared easily:</mark>Data Visualization establishes systems that 
                        enables communication between individuals in the organization
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Better Sales Analysis:</mark> Since humans understand information better via 
                        data visualization as discussed multiple times in this discussion, it will be easier for salespeople 
                        to analyse data on their sales more accurately.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Data Modification:</mark> Based on the concept that information is represented more visually 
                        on a graphical system, data can update, which provides people working in the business the choice 
                        of starting communication systems to stay in touch with their colleagues, manager as well as the audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Exploration of opportunities and trends:</mark> 
                        Presented data in the systems help business leaders broaden their knowledge of the current trends 
                        and opportunities around them after the authorities of data visualization give them a clearer understanding 
                        of the pattern flow in terms of how the customer thinks and acts.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        However, just like every process used for business, including the least preferable ones, 
                        data visualization has disadvantages. This includes:
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Biased information:</mark> There are some people in the organization 
                        that will only take information that is considered important and possibly leave out 
                        other data with prejudiced results.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Skipping of Core messages:</mark> The elaboration of data visualization by the manager is 
                        utterly dependent on the main message. People in the organization that are not properly focused, 
                        would most probably skip the core message of the visual representation of business. 
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Lack of assistance:</mark> One type of audience may interpret the visual representation 
                        of information in different perspective compared to a unique type of audience.

                        The European Union was a political and economic union of the 27 countries in Europe 
                        to promote freedom, peace, and well-being among European Citizens. It also took suitable 
                        measures in regulating immigration and asylum and prevent combat crime.

                        Airbnb apartments at night in the south of France.

                        Histograms show data that is grouped into intervals, specifically the x-axis. 
                        In this case. The price of a certain frequency of Airbnb is grouped into intervals of 10.
