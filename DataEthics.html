                        Companies, in particular technology companies sell personal information to third parties, that will

                    <p>
                        Amazon created a hiring algorithm that would decide which resumes made it to the next hiring 
                        stage to combat issues involving finding candidates for employment. However, a major issue occurs when 
                        the system hired more men than women due to bias that was created due to historical data involved with 
                        employment, which resulted in the algorithm singling out women without prejudice.

                        Facial recognition is widely used, from accessing phones and accounts, to being used as a critical tool for 
                        law enforcement, such as surveillance and screening in airports. However, in 2018, research revealed these 
                        algorithms performed worse on dark-skinned females, up to 34% error rates than that of light-skinned males.

                        <mark>Harms to people:</mark> Impacts person's civil liberties or physical safety, discrimination of a 
                        certain group or repression of democratic participation.

                    <p>
                        Some of these principles include:

                    <p>
                        <mark>Transparency:</mark> It is clear communication of what data will be gathered, where the data will be stored, 
                        and who to share the data with. This is usually done through Terms and Conditions (T&Cs), informing customers how 
                        the company will use their information.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Accountability:</mark> The organization should take responsibility for what happens to an individual's data 
                        after collecting it, whether it be data leaks or information being stolen by hackers, companies should ensure that 
                        they take accountability for damages their processes can cause users.

                        <mark>Individual Agency:</mark> Agency refers to a person's ability to make choices about their personal data. 
                        Whether it involves removing their own data from a website or allowing a company to use their details, allowing 
                        individuals to control what happens to their information should be a human right.
                    </p></br>
                    <p>
                        <mark>Data Privacy:</mark> Privacy refers to one's ability to expect protection from public exposure of their data.
                        As a business, you should protect the user's data if they allow for their personal information to be used.
